<h1>Woolman Shopify products:</h1>
<p>This page is a preliminary task for Woolman's front end Developer trainee position. It took about 8-10 hours to make the page. 
    As requested in the assignment, the page has 5 different pages, each with 50 different products. 
    The name, price and image of the products are visible in the products. 
    There are things on the page that have room for improvement, but I wanted to respect the given timeframe.
    Thank you for looking at my assignment and I hope I get the opportunity to tell you more about my skills and knowledge in an interview.
